            <p>Are you new to practicing yoga? Then this class is perfect for you. It's based on Vinyasa, but it's not as intimidating or intense. This class is best for the days when you want to focus on awareness of movement and breath at a comfortable pace. The gentle transitions between poses encourage mindfulness, resilience, and self-compassion. It's also an excellent way to reset your nervous system if you've been feeling anxious or overwhelmed.</p>

            <p>For students seeking to discover movement, creativity, playfulness, and a profound connection to their breath and body, Vinyasa is a superb option. This particular style encourages imaginative and dynamic movement in sync with your breath's rhythm. Each class will have distinct sequences, and it's probable you'll encounter fresh poses and transitions frequently.</p>
